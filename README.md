### Write latex locally with copilot

- Local compilation (faster than overleaf)

- Autocompletion with copilot (whereas you could also write latex in markdown cells in jupyter notebook, but copilot couldn't autocomplete in markdown cells)

Need to download [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html)

Then install LaTex Workshop extension, and make sure your copilot is working

In a folder, create a `.tex` file, use `Cmd+option+B` to build project, `Cmd+Option+V` to view pdf
