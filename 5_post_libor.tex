\section{Post-LIBOR}
\subsection{Libor Scandal}
In early 2010s, banks like Barclays, UBS, and RBS were found to have manipulated the LIBOR rate.\\
A team within a bank's Treasury or Money Market Desk should independently estimate the rate
at which they can borrow from other banks, without influence from the trading desk.\\
The LIBOR rate is the average of the rates submitted by the banks, 
excluding the highest and lowest 25\% of the submissions.\\
Traders were found to influence the submitters and help out each other,
by submitting lower rates to make them look stronger (when they can't borrow at that rate),
or higher rates when they hold payer IRS (and receive $L - K$).\\

By the 2010s, the volume of unsecured interbank lending had shrunk significantly.
Banks were borrowing less from each other because:\\
Post-2008 regulations (Basel III) discouraged excessive interbank lending.\\
Banks relied more on secured funding (repo markets) rather than unsecured loans.\\
By the time regulators pushed for actual loan-based LIBOR submissions, 
there were only a few billion dollars of daily transactions,
not reliable enough to serve as the benchmark
for hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of financial products that it should.\\

In 2017, the FCA announced that LIBOR would be phased out by 2021,
and replaced by the SONIA rate in the UK, and the SOFR rate in the US.

\begin{itemize}
    \item US: The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) 
    \item UK: The Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA)
    \item Eurozone: The Euro Short-Term Rate (ESTR) and EURIBOR continues to be used
\end{itemize}

Based on those rates, the new IRS is called overnight index swaps.

\subsection{Collateralized vs. Uncollateralized Borrowing Rates}
\begin{definition}
    \textbf{Collateralized Rate} is the rate of loans backed by collateral.\\
    The borrower pledges assets (e.g., government bonds) to secure the loan.
\end{definition}
Examples include SOFR (US) Based on U.S. Treasury-backed repo transactions,
and TONA (Tokyo Overnight Average Rate) based on Japanese government bonds.

On the other hand, both LIBOR and SONIA are uncollateralized rates.\\

Collateralized borrowing rates tend to be lower than 
uncollateralized rates because they have less credit risk.

\subsection{Daily Compounded Rates}
OIS are linked to daily rates, but exchange payments usually FOR 3M, 6M, 1Y, etc.\\
